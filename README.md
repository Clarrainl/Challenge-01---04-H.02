## Overview
<!-- Write Overview about this project -->
The project's justification, state-of-the-art, and inspiration live in this section.


## Challenge_#1
<!-- Write Overview about this project -->
This exercise involves connecting a switch and an LED so that when you press the switch, the LED turns on, and when you release it, the LED turns off. A resistor is used to ensure the circuit works without errors

### Demostration

## Challenge_#2.1
<!-- Write Overview about this project -->
The LED should light up when the button is not pressed and turn off when the button is pressed. This is achieved by changing the logic in the program (or circuit behavior) so the LED operates in reverse: itâ€™s ON by default and turns OFF only when the button is activated.

### Demostration

## Challenge_#2.2
<!-- Write Overview about this project -->
The LED lights up when the button is pressed, but instead of turning off immediately after the button is released, it stays ON for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, the LED automatically turns OFF. This involves adding a timer or delay in the logic to extend the LED's ON state.

### Demostration

## Challenge_#2.3
<!-- Write Overview about this project -->
The button acts as a toggle switch: pressing it once turns the LED ON, and pressing it again turns the LED OFF. This requires logic that tracks the button presses and changes the LED state each time the button is pressed.
